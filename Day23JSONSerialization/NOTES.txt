- dotnet uses a package manager Nuget
- a package is code provided by someone else that you can use in your project
- by invoking the command 
    dotnet add package SomePackageName

    you are telling your project that it needs a package

- when you install a package for the first time in your project, a reference to that package is added in the .csproj file

- when you push a project to your git repository, the package itself is NOT PUSHED, but only the reference to the package

- when you clone your repository to a computer that does not have the package installed, you need to invoke the command
    dotnet restore

    this command will look in your .csproj and download any packages that your project is needing
